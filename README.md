The genotype data for 1,008 F2 intercross segregants can be found in BYxRM_GenoData.txt.

The raw phenotype data for each trait can be found in pheno_raw_BY.Rdata or pheno_raw_synII.Rdata.

We performed multiple regression for the phenotype for each trait with the following covariates: effect of growth on control media YPD, 384-well measurement plate number, row, column, and round. The residuals can be found in cross_BY_res.Rdata or cross_synII_res.Rdata.
